# Yolo-Car-Detection
# ðŸš— Car Counter using YOLO in PyTorch

A real-time vehicle counting system built using the YOLO object detection model in PyTorch. This project detects cars from video streams and counts them as they cross a predefined line, making it ideal for traffic analysis, smart surveillance, or parking lot monitoring.
